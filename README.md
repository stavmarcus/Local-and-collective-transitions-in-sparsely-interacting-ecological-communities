# Local-and-collective-transitions-in-sparsely-interacting-ecological-communities
Code example for the paper Marcus, S., Turner, A.M. and Bunin, G., 2021. Local and collective transitions in sparsely-interacting ecological communities. arXiv preprint arXiv:2110.13603.
Run the main function to get a quick version of Fig. 1 from the paper (with less data points and less runs per data point), showing the relative diversity phi as a function of interaction strength alpha, for a system with S=400, C=3.
