# Local-and-collective-transitions-in-sparsely-interacting-ecological-communities
Code example for the paper: Marcus, S., Turner, A.M. and Bunin, G., 2021. Local and collective transitions in sparsely-interacting ecological communities. arXiv preprint arXiv:2110.13603.
The main function recreates either of two graphs, according to a choice by the user. This is done for less runs per data point and a shorter runtime.
By choosing '1', the code will generate a version of Fig. 1 from the paper (for less data points), showing the relative diversity phi as a function of interaction strength alpha, for a system with S=400, C=3. This can have a long run time. 
By choosing '2', the code will generate a version of Fig. 2E, showing phi as a function of alpha around one of the discontinuous jumps, associated with the critical value of chains of length 4.
